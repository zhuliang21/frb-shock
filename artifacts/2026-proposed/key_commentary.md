# Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario: Key Factor Shocks

## US real GDP and Unemployment

- 4.8% `[computed]` real GDP contraction less than CCAR 2025
- Smaller increase in the unemployment rate reflects the counter-cyclicality element in FRB's Scenario Design Framework

## Interest Rates

- Short-term interest rates, as measured by the 3-month Treasury rate, drops to 0.1% `[computed]`, as 10-year Treasury yield falls 200bps `[computed]`
- Less downward rate compared with CCAR 2025, but the term spread (10Y-3M) is similar
- Treasury yield curve remains inverted for 2026Q1, but then slope turns positive and steepens as CCAR 2025

## Credit spreads

- BBB Corp spread widens to 5.7% `[computed]` (+4.4ppts `[computed]`)
- This is a less severe shock than CCAR 2025, reflecting smaller spillover effect from less severe stress in commercial real estate markets

## Equity prices and volatility

- -54% `[computed]`; smaller shock than CCAR 2025
- Peak VIX is 72 `[computed]`, less than CCAR 2025, but from a higher starting point

## Property Prices

- CRE and HPI shock less to CCAR 2025, reflecting the counter-cyclicality element in FRB's Scenario Design Framework

## FX Rates

- Flight-to-safety asset flows cause USD to appreciate vs euro, pound and Dev. Asia currencies, but depreciate vs yen.
- Larger EUR, GBP, and Dev. Asia FX depreciations, and larger JPY appreciation, relative to CCAR 2025

## Non-US GDP

- Emphasis on growth shocks to advanced foreign economies (UK, Eurozone, Japan)
- Less severe recessions in UK, Japan and Developing Asia compared to CCAR 2025, Eurozone has the same recession as CCAR 2025

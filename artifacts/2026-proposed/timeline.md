# Timeline

- CMAO scenario team is working to create an expanded data set of macro factors for each scenario (Baseline, Severely Adverse) applying the FRB's 28 macro factors and qualitative guidance material
- There will be no separate macro scenario publication for the exploratory analysis since the macro assumptions are identical to the severely adverse scenario.

1. Preliminary scenarios (Baseline and Severely Adverse) will be available in CME by **Sunday, February 8**
2. R&C feedback is due **Tuesday, February 10**
3. Model owners will sign attestation forms for Tier I factors by **Saturday, February 14 (EOD)**
4. Scenarios finalized and approved for release in CME at Stress Testing SteerCo on **Saturday, February 14**

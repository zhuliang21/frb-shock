# Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario: Key Factor Shocks

## US real GDP and Unemployment

- 7.8% `[computed]` real GDP contraction less than CCAR 2024
- Smaller increase in the unemployment rate reflects the counter-cyclicality element in FRB's Scenario Design Framework

## Interest Rates

- Short-term interest rates, as measured by the 3-month Treasury rate, drops to 0.1% `[computed]`, as 10-year Treasury yield falls 330bps `[computed]`
- Less downward rate compared with CCAR 2024, but the term spread (10Y-3M) is similar
- Treasury yield curve remains inverted for 2025Q1, but then slope turns positive and steepens as CCAR 2024

## Credit spreads

- BBB Corp spread widens to 5.0% `[computed]` (+3.9ppts `[computed]`)
- This is a less severe shock than CCAR 2024, reflecting smaller spillover effect from less severe stress in commercial real estate markets

## Equity prices and volatility

- -50% `[computed]`; smaller shock than CCAR 2024
- Peak VIX is 65 `[computed]`, less than CCAR 2024, but from a higher starting point

## Property Prices

- CRE and HPI shock less to CCAR 2024, reflecting the counter-cyclicality element in FRB's Scenario Design Framework

## FX Rates

- Flight-to-safety asset flows cause USD to appreciate vs euro, pound and Dev. Asia currencies, but depreciate vs yen.
- Larger EUR, GBP, and Dev. Asia FX depreciations, and larger JPY appreciation, relative to CCAR 2024

## Non-US GDP

- Emphasis on growth shocks to advanced foreign economies (UK, Eurozone, Japan)
- Less severe recessions in UK, Japan and Developing Asia compared to CCAR 2024, Eurozone has the same recession as CCAR 2024
